Developed by the [Data Science and Data Engineering](http://www.broadinstitute.org/dsde)
group at the [Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org/), the GATK toolkit offers
a wide variety of tools with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping.
Its powerful processing engine and high-performance computing features make it capable
of taking on projects of any size.

### VariantEval
[VariantEval](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_varianteval_VariantEval.php)
is a general-purpose tool for variant evaluation. It gives information about percentage of
variants in dbSNP, genotype concordance, Ti/Tv ratios and a lot more.
