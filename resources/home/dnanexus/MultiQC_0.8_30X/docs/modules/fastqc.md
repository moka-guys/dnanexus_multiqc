The FastQC module parses results generated by
[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/),
a  quality control tool for high throughput sequence data written
by Simon Andrews at the Babraham Institute.

FastQC generates a HTML report which is what most people use when
they run the program. However, it also helpfully generates a file
called `fastqc_data.txt` which is relatively easy to parse.

A typical run will produce the following files:
```
mysample_fastqc.html
mysample_fastqc/
  Icons/
  Images/
  fastqc.fo
  fastqc_data.txt
  fastqc_report.html
  summary.txt
```
Sometimes the directory is zipped, with just `mysample_fastqc.zip`.

The FastQC MultiQC module looks for files called `fastqc_data.txt`
or ending in `_fastqc.zip`. If the zip files are found, they are
read in memory and `fastqc_data.txt` parsed.

> **Note:** The directory and zip file are often both present. To speed
> up MultiQC execution, zip files will be skipped if the file name suggests
> that they will share a sample name with data that has already been parsed.

You can customise the patterns used for finding these files in your
MultiQC config using the following base - see the docs for more
details..
```yaml
sp:
    fastqc:
        data:
            fn: fastqc_data.txt
        zip:
            fn: _fastqc.zip
```

> **Note:** Sample names are discovered by parsing the line beginning
> `Filename` in `fastqc_data.txt`, _not_ based on the FastQC report names.
