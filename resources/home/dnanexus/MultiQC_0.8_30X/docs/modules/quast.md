Description: >
    A Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies by
    the Center for Algorithmic Biotechnology.
---

[QUAST](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/) evaluates genome assemblies by
computing various metrics, including

* N50, length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or
  longer covers at least 50% of assembly length
* NG50, where length of the reference genome is being covered
* NA50 and NGA50, where aligned blocks instead of contigs are taken
* Misassemblies, misassembled and unaligned contigs or contigs bases
* Genes and operons covered

The QUAST MultiQC module parses the `report.tsv` files generated by
QUAST and adds key metrics to the report General Statistics table.
All statistics for all samples are saved to `multiqc_data/multiqc_quast.txt`.
